/*
   This pass will identify native methods which are (un)reachable, ignoring
   "blanket native" proguard rules which keep all native methods and classes
   with native methods, e.g.

   -keepclasseswithmembers class * {
      native <methods>;
    }

    It just runs reachability analysis in the same way as RMU does, but does
    not mark "blanket native" classes/methods as roots.  Classes and methods
    which are kept only due to a "blanket native" rule have been identified
    during proguard processing and stored in RedexContext.

    Results are written to a file, named "redex-reachable-natives.txt" by
    default, and stats on the number of (un)reachable native methods are
    logged.
