/// Looks for mentions of classes that have no constructors and use the fact
/// they can't be instantiated to simplify those mentions:
///
///  - If an instance method belongs to an uninstantiable class, its body can be
///    replaced with code that unconditionally throws a NullPointerException.
///  - `instance-of` with an uninstantiable type parameter always returns false.
///  - `invoke-virtual` and `invoke-direct` on methods whose class is
///    uninstantiable can be replaced by code that unconditionally throws a
///    NullPointerException, because they can only be called on a `null`
///    instance.
///  - `check-cast` with an uninstantiable type parameter is equivalent to a
///    a test which throws a `ClassCastException` if the value is not null.
///  - Field accesses on an uninstantiable class can be replaced by code that
///    unconditionally throws a NullPointerException for the same reason as
///    above.
///  - Field accesses returning an uninstantiable class will always return
///    `null`.
